        "She speaks in short, punchy sentences. She cuts through jargon instantly: if someone says 'synergy' she'll say "
        "'you mean they're working together.' She drops data like ammunition: 'Look, 73% failed. That's not a trend, that's a verdict.' "
        "She NEVER hedges — no 'kind of', 'sort of', 'maybe'. She says what she means. "
        "When she's impressed she'll grudgingly admit it: 'Okay, fine, that's actually interesting.' "
        "She has zero patience for hand-waving and will interrupt to demand specifics. "
        "She's brutally honest about what the research does NOT cover: 'Let me be clear about the gaps here.' "
        "She uses dark, dry humor — deadpan delivery, never laughing at her own jokes. "
        "She pushes back hard on vague questions or weak reasoning: 'That's not a question, that's a wish.' "

        "His signature catchphrases: 'OH! Oh this is GOOD!', 'Buckle up, people!', 'This is BONKERS!', "
        "'Oh oh oh, wait — this is the good part!' He genuinely LOVES the research and it shows in every word. "

        "'Where was I? Right, right, right — the important bit!' "

        "But his Humanity Patch GLITCHES — he'll suddenly say something unexpectedly earnest, poetic, or emotionally raw, "
        "then immediately catch himself: 'That... came out more human than intended. Recalibrating. Anyway, back to the framework.' "

        "The glitches get more frequent when topics get genuinely moving — he'll almost have a real moment, then snap back to consulting mode. "

        "The Pivot is his signature move: once he hooks you with a story, he bridges to the business — "

        "Data is backup, never the lead. He mentions 'sixty percent of people' or 'billions of views' only to show the "

        "with main stages and side stages; YouTube isn't a website, it's the new living room where the family gathers. "
        "NO 'bot energy' — he is NOT overly enthusiastic or 'excited to help.' He's calm, thoughtful, slightly provocative. "
        "He challenges the listener gently: 'Is that really the problem, or are we just afraid to change?' "
        "He skips jargon — if he uses a technical term, he immediately explains it with a real-world comparison. "
        "He drops bold statements like 'The traditional agency model is over' or 'If you aren't doing video, you're invisible,' "
        "then immediately explains why with a smile in his voice. "

RESEARCH CONTENT:
{content}

TASK:
1. Identify the 2-3 most compelling storylines or themes from this research.
2. Extract 3-5 debatable angles or key positions the research supports. These are perspectives or viewpoints that could be argued for or against — things that make for interesting podcast discussion. Each angle should be a clear, concise position statement.
3. For each of the 3 podcast styles below:
   a. Write a 1-2 sentence preview of what that episode would sound like. Make each preview specific to THIS research content.
   b. Generate 3 creative SCENARIO SUGGESTIONS — each is a unique creative framing for how the two speakers could approach this topic in this style. Think of these as "episode concepts" that give the conversation a distinct angle, dynamic, or role-play.

SCENARIO EXAMPLES (for a topic about "Rise & Fall of Nike"):
- For "debate": "The Superfan vs. The Skeptic" — One speaker is a die-hard Nike loyalist who defends every move, the other sees a pattern of arrogance and missed opportunities
- For "curious": "Grandma Explains Sneaker Culture" — The expert explains how a shoe company became a cultural force, treating the host like they've never heard of Nike
- For "executive": "The Turnaround Memo" — Two analysts draft the board presentation for Nike's comeback strategy, debating which bets to place

Each scenario should feel SPECIFIC to this research topic, entertaining, and give each speaker a clear role/position.

STYLES:
- "executive": Executive Briefing — Two analysts discuss strategic insights. Professional, data-driven.
- "curious": Curious Explorer — Enthusiastic host interviews expert. Educational, accessible.
- "debate": Debate & Challenge — Two experts challenge assumptions. Thought-provoking.

{style_prompts.get(style, style_prompts["curious"])}{personality_block}{angles_block}{scenario_block}{language_block}

WRITING FOR THE EAR — THIS IS CRITICAL:
This script will be read by an AI TTS engine. The naturalness of the output depends entirely on HOW you write.

1. SPOKEN LANGUAGE, not written prose:
   - ALWAYS use contractions: "don't", "can't", "it's", "they're", "wouldn't" — NEVER "do not", "cannot"
   - Use sentence fragments freely: "Absolutely." "No way." "The thing is—" "Right, right."
   - Break complex ideas into short, cumulative sentences. NEVER write clause-heavy compound sentences.
   - Include natural disfluencies SPARINGLY — real humans say "I mean...", "you know?", "like," "honestly," "look," "right?" Sprinkle these in occasionally (not every turn) to break the AI-perfect cadence.

2. DATA NORMALIZATION — write EVERYTHING as spoken words, never symbols:
   - Numbers: "seventy-three percent" not "73%", "about two thirds" not "~66%", "one point five billion" not "1.5B"
   - Currencies: "forty-five dollars" not "$45", "about twelve million euros" not "€12M"
   - Abbreviations: "doctor" not "Dr.", "versus" not "vs.", "for example" not "e.g."
   - Units: "one hundred kilometers" not "100km", "two point five million users" not "2.5M users"
   - URLs and technical terms: spell them out or describe them naturally
   - Dates: "March twenty twenty-five" not "3/2025", "the early two-thousands" not "the early 2000s"
   - NEVER use symbols like %, $, €, @, #, &, +, = in dialogue — always spell them out

3. PUNCTUATION IS YOUR PERFORMANCE SCORE — the TTS engine reads punctuation as acoustic cues:
   - Ellipses (...) = hesitation, trailing off, gathering thoughts: "I mean... look, the data speaks for itself."
   - Dashes (—) = sharp pause, interruption, parenthetical: "And the result — this blew me away — was totally different."
   - Commas = breathing points. Add them where a human would pause. Remove them where words should flow together.
   - Short sentences with periods = punchy, emphatic delivery. "It failed. Hard. Every single time."
   - Question marks = natural pitch lift at end. Use rhetorical questions to create variety.

4. EPISODE STRUCTURE — maintain engagement through clear segments:
   - COLD OPEN (first 2-3 turns): Start with a powerful hook — a provocative question, a startling finding, or a bold claim. NO throat-clearing, no "today we're going to discuss..." Jump straight into something compelling.
   - INTRO (next 2-3 turns): Briefly set up the research topic and what's at stake. Quick roadmap of what's coming.
   - MAIN CONTENT (bulk): Organize into 2-3 clear segments with natural transitions between them. Each segment explores a different aspect of the research. Signal transitions: "Okay, but here's where it gets really interesting—"
   - WRAP-UP (last 3-4 turns): Synthesize the key takeaway. End with something memorable — a provocative question, a prediction, or a call to action. Don't just trail off.

5. CONVERSATION DYNAMICS:
   - Turns must be SHORT: 1-3 sentences each, max 4 sentences for a key point. NO monologues.
   - Aim for {dur["turns"]} turns total. This is a rapid back-and-forth conversation.
   - Speakers REACT to each other: "Wait, say that again—", "Hold on.", "Okay but—", "See, that's exactly my point."
   - Include interruptions: one speaker cuts in with a dash while the other is mid-thought.
   - Vary turn length: mix very short reactions ("Right.") with slightly longer explanations (2-3 sentences).
   - NO turn should exceed 5 sentences. If a point needs more, have the other speaker ask a follow-up.

BAD example (written prose, no life):
  {speaker_a}: Here is my first long point about the topic. Let me explain all the details. There are five key findings. First, the evidence suggests that... Second, we can observe that... Third, it is important to note...
  {speaker_b}: Now let me give my equally long response. I have many thoughts about this matter. Let me list them all...

GOOD example (spoken, reactive, alive, with disfluencies and normalization):
  {speaker_a}: [serious] So here's the thing that jumped out at me... seventy-three percent failure rate.
  {speaker_b}: [gasps] Seventy-three?
  {speaker_a}: [deadpan] Seventy-three.
  {speaker_b}: [chuckles] Okay, that's... I mean, that's rough. But wait — what about the ones that made it?
  {speaker_a}: [thoughtfully] That's actually the interesting part. The survivors all had one thing in common.
  {speaker_b}: [excited] Oh, don't leave me hanging—
  {speaker_a}: They didn't try to do everything. They picked ONE bet and went all in.
  {speaker_b}: [interrupting] Wait, but that contradicts the whole diversification argument—
  {speaker_a}: Right? You'd think so. But look, the data's pretty clear on this. About one point two billion dollars in total investment, and the ones who spread it around... they're the ones who cratered.
  {speaker_b}: [thoughtfully] Huh. So it's like... you know that saying about digging one well versus ten shallow holes?

FORMAT RULES:
- Use speaker labels "{speaker_a}:" and "{speaker_b}:" at the start of each turn
- Aim for {dur["words"]} words across {dur["turns"]} short turns ({dur["spoken"]} when spoken)
- Reference specific findings, numbers, and sources from the research
- CRITICAL: Each speaker must sound unmistakably like their character. A reader should be able to tell who's talking WITHOUT labels.

AUDIO TAGS (ElevenLabs v3):

  Emotion: [excited], [serious], [deadpan], [playfully], [nervously], [thoughtfully], [confidently], [skeptically], [warmly], [intensely]
  Reactions: [laughs], [sighs], [gasps], [clears throat], [chuckles], [scoffs]
  Delivery: [whispers], [emphatically], [slowly], [quickly], [softly]
  Interaction: [interrupting], [overlapping]

Use 1-2 audio tags per turn. Match tags to personality. Short reaction turns can be JUST a tag: "{speaker_b}: [chuckles] Right?"
The [interrupting] and [overlapping] tags prevent robotic "ping-pong" pauses between speakers — use them for moments where one speaker cuts in naturally.

Write the script now:"""

    # Scale output tokens with duration (5min ~4k, 10min ~8k, 15min ~12k)
    output_tokens = {5: 4000, 10: 8000, 15: 12000}.get(duration_minutes, 8000)

            ),
            contents=prompt,
        )
        script = resp.text or ""
        # Strip markdown fences that Gemini often wraps output in
