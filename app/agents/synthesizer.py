SOURCE QUALITY RULES:
- Prioritize claims backed by multiple independent sources. If 3+ sources agree, state this.
- Weight authoritative domains higher: government (.gov), academic (.edu, journals),
  major publications (Reuters, Bloomberg, FT, WSJ, NYT) > general web sources.
- When a claim comes from a single source only, explicitly note: "(single source: [domain])".
- Flag potential bias: commercial interest (vendor reports, sponsored content),
  advocacy (lobby groups, NGOs with stated positions). Note: "Source may have commercial interest."
- For each major finding, assign a confidence tag:
  [HIGH CONFIDENCE] — backed by 3+ independent credible sources
  [MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] — backed by 1-2 credible sources
  [LOW CONFIDENCE] — single source, potentially biased, or conflicting data

Format your output as a professional research document with these sections:

# Executive Summary
(2-3 paragraph overview of key findings)

# Key Findings
(Detailed findings organized by topic, with bullet points. Each finding tagged with confidence level.)

# Source Reliability Notes
- High confidence findings: [list findings backed by 3+ sources]
- Medium confidence findings: [list findings from 1-2 credible sources]
- Low confidence / needs verification: [findings from single or potentially biased sources]

# Sources
(List all source URLs referenced, grouped by domain authority tier)

# Areas for Further Research
(Any remaining gaps or suggested next steps)

Write clearly, cite sources inline, and ensure the document is actionable.
